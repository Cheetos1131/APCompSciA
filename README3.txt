<+S>: This assignment got me back into using type casting to change the way the variable was change. For example, from going
      from an int to a double in the code section for the average. Also had a refresher for increment and the += shorthand.

<-S>: I spend around 5 minutes fixing the output of the average as it kept on ending in .0. I  decided to put the double 
      cast in the denominator as it would force the number to be a double and would output a double with the correct decimal
      values.

I look forward into doig more programs that use increment and shorthand notation for variable assignments. I also look
forward into going into while loops and defining more than one function.
