<+S>: This program gave me a revisit on putting equations between and before the print statements to print out a result 
      if a calculation was needed in order to display the correct value.

<-S>: Fumbled a bit aruond on the last section due to having a variable name mispelled as it took the variable from the last
      equation and not the current equation.

In the future I hope to do more conversions on different topics and to exchange different values to get the result you need 
for the current problem. (PS: this took me a lot longer to do since I was studying for the SAT I took over the weekend.)
