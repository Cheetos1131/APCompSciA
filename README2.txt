<+S>: This assigment gave me a small refresher on concatenation and the use of doubles and integers.
      In the years I spent programming in C++ I mainly used the float type instead of the double type as I did not need as
      much precision in the number and to reduce on how much memory was used to contain the value in the variable. This also
      gave me another refresher on the modulus operater as that was sort of tested heavily on the psuedocode section of the 
      AICE Computer Science exam.

<-S>: I had to play with the paranthesis around the equations a bit as it would sometimes give out the wrong anser and to
      also improve readability as sticking all the operands and operators next to each other does not look good and it does
      not work sometimes in calculations as it can give a wrong answer.

In the future I can't wait to go back and use the other variable types. I can also not wait to go back to iteration and 
recursion as it was a fun topic when going over how it worked and how the computer parts handled the problem.
