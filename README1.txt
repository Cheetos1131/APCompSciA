<+S>: I used the VS Code IDE as it was my prefered IDE to use. This assigment gave me a refresher on the syntax of java as I
      have not used java since I finished my AICE Computer Science exam on May 7th. I did not have many errors as the task 
      was simple and had the Intellisense extension in the background to help me autofix some errors.

<-S>: I had to disable some extensions on my IDE since I would accidentally hit tab and it would autocomplete some random
      function that would have been used if I had imported the math module.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future I will need to disable some extensions so it will not mess with my code and I can also look back at this 
assigment to look over the basics if I ever need to.
